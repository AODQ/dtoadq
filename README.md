# raycaster
A bidirectional metropolis light transport raycaster currently being written in D. Planned features:
  - GPU accelerated via OpenCL1.2
  - KD-tree accelerated
  - Renders an entire scene in real-time with a moveable camera
  
The purpose is to allow me to play around with different/new ideas when it comes to MLT raycasting.
