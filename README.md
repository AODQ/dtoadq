# raytracer
A metropolis light transport voxel raytracer currently being written in D. Planned features:
  - GPU accelerated via OpenCL1.2
  - octree-accelerated
  - Renders an entire scene in real-time with a moveable camera
  
The purpose is to allow me to play around with different/new ideas when it comes to MLT raytracing. My next goal after this is procedurally generated voxel models and voxel cone tracing.
